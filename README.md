## Guess Who

This project goal's was to create the game Guess Who with Disney characters. 
You can play it online using 2 devices (one for each player).

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

#### What I've practiced/learned:
- Anchor to the same page (HTML);
- Responsive design (CSS);
- Hover effects(CSS);
- Switch (JavaScript);
- Refresh the page (JavaScript);
- Arrays (JavaScript);
- Adding a collaborator (GitHub);
- Requesting code review (GitHub).
